# The Next Big Writer

## About

This idea was born in one of our monthly meetups. Folks had written drafts on some of the topics but were scared to put them out there. On probing further, it was the case that they didn‚Äôt want to publicly associate the post with their names in case it doesn‚Äôt get good reception. This traps them in a vicious cycle: They don‚Äôt publish because they feel the writing is not good enough, and the writing can‚Äôt improve without feedback!  
To solve this problem, we are announcing ‚ÄúThe Next Big Writer‚Äù experiment:

* Write your post in markdown and submit a PR under drafts folder.
* It will be published to Hashnode under the "The Next Big Writer" publication.
* It‚Äôll be shared on Twitter and our Telegram group.

The aim is to get you to reach so that you get feedback (likes/comments), which is the only way to improve.
